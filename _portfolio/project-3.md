## Overview
- **Objective:** Explore how generative AI can co-create narrative arcs and dialogue for long-running series.
- **Approach:** Curated training corpora from publicly available scripts, tokenized scenes, and fine-tuned an RNN language model to mirror show-specific tones.
- **Impact:** Produced draft scripts that reduced blank-page time for writers and inspired experiments with character-driven plotlines.
