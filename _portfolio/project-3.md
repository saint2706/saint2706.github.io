This project involved the development of an AI model capable of generating original screenplays for new episodes of any given TV show. The model was built using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn the patterns and styles of existing scripts. This project provided a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of creative writing and artificial intelligence.
