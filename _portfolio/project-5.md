This project is a comprehensive coding curriculum and tutorial series designed specifically for MBA students who are interested in learning how to code. The curriculum is hosted on GitHub Pages and provides a structured learning path for students with little to no prior coding experience. The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between business and technology by empowering future business leaders with the technical skills they need to succeed in a data-driven world.
